The Professional URL Shortener is a modern, responsive web application built with React that allows users to convert long, unwieldy URLs into short, shareable links. It is designed to demonstrate best practices 
in frontend development, user authentication, and session management.

Key aspects of this project:
Authentication: Users log in using a secure token-based system, demonstrating handling of protected API endpoints.

Custom Short Codes & Expiry: Users can personalize their short links and set a validity period, showing flexibility in URL management.

Session-based History: All shortened URLs in a session are displayed in a structured table, providing a professional user experience.

Logging & Observability: Actions like login, URL shortening, and logout are logged in the console to simulate real-world monitoring practices.

Responsive UI: Clean and intuitive design that works across devices, demonstrating attention to user experience.
